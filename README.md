## Scraping and visualizing the best Graduates (University of Duisburg-Essen)

This repository contains an R script that scrapes the best graduates of the University of Duisburg-Essen (winners of the *Dies Academicus*) between 2013 and 2025 from the University website (https://www.uni-due.de/de/absolventenehrung/fak2025.php) and visualizes the results in a Shiny dashboard. The Shiny dashboard is hosted and can be viewed [here](https://schulznoah.shinyapps.io/best_graduates_uni_due/).
